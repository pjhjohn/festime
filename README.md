# festime

Fastest way to share your own festival timetable

## tl;dr
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pjhjohn/festime && cd festime
npm install
npm start
```

## Getting Started

### Download

Cloning this repository with a few additional following commands will do the trick!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pjhjohn/festime && cd festime
```

### `npm install`

Runs the installation of dependency packages described in `package.json`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance using Webpack.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

You may also serve it locally with a static server:

```sh
npm install -g pushstate-server
pushstate-server build
open http://localhost:9000
```

### ~~`npm run eject`~~ : Already Ejected

In `package.json`, packages in `devDependencies` are purely generated by **`npm run eject`**  
Place your project dependency packages in `dependencies` using following command
```
npm install --save <PACKAGE_NAME>
```

## Project Hierachy

```
festime/
  config/
  node_modules/
  scripts/
  src/
  .gitignore
  index.html
  package.json
  README.md
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

> `index.html` : page template  
> `src/favicon.ico` : icon you see in the browser tab  
> `src/index.js` : JavaScript entry point  

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories under `src/`. For faster rebuilds, only files under `src/` are processed by Webpack. Webpack wonâ€™t see them **unless putting JS and CSS files under `src/`**

You can, however, create more top-level directories. Feel free to use them for things like documentation **since they will not be included in the production build**.
